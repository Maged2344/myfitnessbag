## 📂 What’s Inside?

📦 **Orders - Completed**  
Track all the swole deliveries we actually got to the finish line 🏁

🚚 **Orders - Out for Delivery**  
Like a protein bar in transit — it’s on the way

💰 **Cash Cycle Tracker**  
Know when the money flows in — and when it sprints back out

---

## 💪 Why Excel?

Because **Google Sheets don't flex hard enough** — and we need pivot tables with delts.

These spreadsheets help the MyFitnessBag team:

- Monitor daily ops like a hawk on creatine  
- Stay financially jacked  
- Keep our delivery reps lean, mean, and well-tracked
